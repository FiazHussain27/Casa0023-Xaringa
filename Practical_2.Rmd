# Practical 2  
## Sentinel‑2 Band Composites & Interpretation

---

# What This Practical Covered

- Loading Sentinel‑2 imagery in SNAP  
- Exploring spectral bands  
- Creating RGB composites  
- Understanding reflectance behaviour  
- Interpreting land cover from band combinations  

---

# Sentinel‑2 Bands Used

- **B4 (Red)**  
- **B3 (Green)**  
- **B2 (Blue)**  
- **B8 (NIR)**  

These bands allow both true‑colour and false‑colour visualisation.

---

# True Colour Composite (B4, B3, B2)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/fiazg/Documents/CASA/Remote Sensing/Practical_2/images/RGB_Landsat_clipped_RGB.png")
```

---

# False Colour Vegetation (B8, B4, B3)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/fiazg/Documents/CASA/Remote Sensing/Practical_2/images/False_Landsat_clipped_RGB.png")
```

# Interpretation Notes

- Vegetation appears **bright red** in false‑colour due to strong NIR reflectance  
- Water appears **dark** in both composites  
- Built‑up areas show **high reflectance** in visible bands  
- Soil brightness varies with moisture and mineral content  

---

# Reflection

- This practical reinforced how different band combinations reveal different land‑surface properties  
- Seeing the NIR response of vegetation made spectral theory more intuitive  
- SNAP workflows are becoming more familiar and efficient  
- Understanding these basics prepares for indices, masking, and classification in later weeks
